Azure Synapse Analytics and AI
A hypothetical company would like to gain business insights using historical, real-time, and predictive analytics using structured and unstructured data sources. In doing so, they want to enable their IT team of data engineers and data scientists to bring in and run complex queries over petabytes of structured data with billions of rows and unstructured enterprise operational data. At the same time, they want to enable business analysts and their IT team to share a single source of truth and have a single workspace to collaborate and work with enterprise data and enriched customer data. They want to accomplish this by minimizing the number of disparate services they use across ingest, transformation, querying, and storage so that their team of data engineers, data scientists, and database administrators can master one tool, and can build shared best practices for development, management, and monitoring.

this process automation script cover data loading, data preparation, data transformation, and data serving, along with performing machine learning and handling both batch and real-time data.

We will be leveraging Azure Synapse Studio, a tool that conveniently unifies the most common data operations from ingestion, transformation, querying, and visualization.

 The following resources will be deployed on azure:
 
Azure Synapse Analytics
Azure Storage and Azure Data Lake gen 2
Azure Machine Learning
Azure App Service
Azure Machine Learning
Apache Spark pool
Sql pool
Azure blob storage
Azure Key fault

Next we will run a power shell on the azure portal using thr automated script on github to create our datasets, data flow, pipelines and linked services on azure synapse.
